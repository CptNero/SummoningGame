     Primary School Report
-----------------------------------
Student Name: Timothy Little

Grade: 3

Teacher: Mrs. Smith

School Year: 2003-2004

Report Date: April 15, 2004

Behavioral Assessment:

James Johnson has exhibited concerning behavior throughout this school year.
He has struggled to control his emotions and actions, often resorting to physical aggression and violence towards his peers and teachers.
He was particularly hard to control in the context of online video games. Despite this he seems to be a particularly bright student.
I urge you to look into this violent behavior.
