Testimonial of Grandma Sparks

My grandchild was always a very sweet kid, although he sometimes hung out with a weird crowd.
They all loved wearing all black suits and fedoras. He was always busy, I’m sure they had lots of fun together, whatever they did.
They called themselves the Mafia or something. He wouldn’t really talk about it.
But one thing that my heart couldn’t bear was when he entered the kitchen. He never respected the food, by god he would break Spaghetti before boiling, could you imagine!


-----------------------------------
 Grandma Sparks' perfect Spaghetti
-----------------------------------
Ingredients:

    1 pound (450g) spaghetti
    2 tablespoons olive oil
    4 cloves garlic, minced
    1 onion, finely chopped
    1 pound (450g) ground beef
    1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes
    2 teaspoons dried oregano
    1 teaspoon dried basil
    Salt and pepper to taste
    Grated Parmesan cheese for serving
    Fresh basil leaves for garnish

    Note: If you respect your heritage and the culture of food, never ever break the un-boiled Spaghetti in half!
          Do not betray your heritage like that! Some people in our family consider food their religion!

Enjoy!
