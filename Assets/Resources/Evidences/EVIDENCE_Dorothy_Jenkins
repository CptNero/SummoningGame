“The person handling the report had to suddenly resign after filing Mrs. Jenkins’ documents. We haven’t heard from them since. Weird.”

    Cryptic Resignation Note
-----------------------------------
To Whom It May Concern,

I regret to inform you that I must tender my resignation, effective immediately.
My time here has been both enlightening and harrowing.
However, recent events have led me to realize that I have seen too much.
There are depths to this organization's sinners violent crimes that I fear I can no longer navigate without sacrificing my own sanity and safety.

I leave behind this cryptic message as a warning to those who dare to delve too deep. I hope you get to live another day and leave ASAP.

Sincerely,

[REDACTED]
