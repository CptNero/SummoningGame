However, recent events have\nled me to realize that I have seen too much.\nThere are depths to this organization's sinners\nviolent crimes that I fear I can no longer\nnavigate without sacrificing my own sanity and safety.\n\nI leave behind this message as a warning to those\nwho dare to delve too deep. I hope you get to live\nanother day and leave ASAP.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[REDACTED]"
