They called themselves the\n Mafia or something. He wouldn’t really talk about it.\n But one thing that my heart couldn’t bear was when\n he entered the kitchen. He never respected the food,\n by god he would break Spaghetti before boiling,\n could you imagine!\n\n-----------------------------------\n Grandma Sparks' perfect Spaghetti recipe\n-----------------------------------\nIngredients:\n\n 1 pound (450g) spaghetti\n 2 tablespoons olive oil\n 4 cloves garlic, minced\n 1 onion, finely chopped\n 1 pound (450g) ground beef\n 1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes\n 2 teaspoons dried oregano\n 1 teaspoon dried basil\n Salt and pepper to taste\n Grated Parmesan cheese for serving\n Fresh basil leaves for garnish\n\n Note: If you respect your heritage and the \n culture of food, never ever break the un-boiled \n Spaghetti in half! Do not betray your heritage\n \n like that! Some people in our family\n \n consider food their religion!\nEnjoy!"
